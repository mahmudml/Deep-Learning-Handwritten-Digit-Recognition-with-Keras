Handwritten Digit Recognition with Keras

This repository contains deep learning models developed in Python using the Keras library for the MNIST handwritten digit recognition problem. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, with each image being 28x28 pixels in size. The goal of this project is to develop models that can accurately recognize the digit in each image.

Models:
This project includes the following models for handwritten digit recognition:
-Baseline Model with Multilayer Perceptrons
-Simple Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST
-Larger Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST
Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up the project and run the models on your local machine.

Prerequisites:
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

Python 3.x
Keras
TensorFlow
Numpy

Running the Models:
To run any of the models, simply open the corresponding python file in your preferred text editor and run the script. The models have been developed using Jupyter Lab, so you can also run them in Jupyter by opening the corresponding notebook file.

Results:
The results of each model will be displayed in the form of accuracy metrics and loss plots. The models have been trained and tested on the MNIST dataset, and the results can be compared to evaluate the performance of each model.

Contributing:
If you want to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. For any major changes, please open an issue to discuss the change you would like to make.
